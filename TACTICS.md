WARNING: Right now this is just a placeholder for ideas that don't belong in the main strategy document, and are specific prescription that aren't a fit for every organization.  It's unorganized and unfiltered.  Too long. Don't read.


How do we get there?  Let's try to identify a set of values that support the value we are trying to optimize for.

As a bit of a thought experiment let's imagine a perfect abstracted support engagement: 

- the user has a problem
- they describe that problem clearly (guide engagement)
- support responds in a timeframe the user can accept (responsiveness)
- customer feels that they have been heard (empathy)
- the resolution is accepted by the customer (competence)
- customer feels they can trust communication from the organization (trust)
- customer feels that the organization is competent (respect)
- customer feels loyalty to the organization (love)
- actionable information from the engagement is captured, digested and concisely communicated to the organization (signal)

To see an exceptional result like this we need agents who can employ positivity, empathy, integrity, competence and responsiveness.  Let's consider how to build an environment where folks with these traits can thrive, an environment that supports and develops these traits.  I argue that the generally prescribed support best practices actually create an environment antagonistic to these talented folks.

### Don't incentivise metrics or govern by SLA
Metrics are useful signals, but keep in mind they are just that.  They need to be interpreted in context. When abused they can be destructive:

-**Metrics get gamed**: We have all seen metrics as goals lead to perverse incentives.  For example; an agent optimizing for response volume with innapropriate copy pasted responses.  Agents are smart, and will figure out how to manipulate metrics if they think the numbers are the measuring stick.
- **Metrics are a poor way to compare agents**:  Let's say you have an agent with a ticket volume of 100 and an agent with a ticket volume of 10.  Who is performing better?  You dig in to the actual tickets and find out the low volume agent is tackling harder issues and less likely to force close a ticket until he is sure the customer is satisfied. 
- **Metrics are innacurate signals at small sample sizes**
- **Metrics are blind**: Metrics miss a good part of the story.  What metric expresses properly executed triage?
- **Incentivized metrics crushes morale pt 1**:  Just because we can create tooling that surveils and algorithmically scores every aspect of employee performance doesn't mean we should do it.  It's a message: "We don't trust you".  If you want to create an environment that fosters trust and empathy you need to employ it in your management practice as well.
- **Incentivized metrics crushes morale pt 2**:  Ever been held responsible for a number that's out of your control?  Support metrics are often driven by organizational policy, third party vendor failures or other factors they aren't remotely responsible for.  It's very demotivating when you are set up to fail.  
- **Incentived metrics attack team diversity**:  When you incentivize one very specific thing, you optimize for a certain type of person and disregard folks that don't fit.  Your team will be made up of individuals with various strengths and weaknesses.  
- **Metrics are less reliable at small sample sizes**:  

### Boost loyalty and engagement
A support engagement is a powerful opportunity to turn a negative experience into a net positive. How do we support the following traits:

- **Empathy and positivity**:
- **Integrity and transparency**:  
- **Competence**: The core purpose of support
- **Responsiveness**:

### Serve as the signal
- Bug reports
- Champion feature requests
- Identify customer sentiment
- Support at the decision making table

## Communicate with transparency and integrity
Transparency and integrity aren't just some do gooderish ideals, they provide solid business value.  Trust is an asset.  A customer is more likely to stick with you after a crisis if they believe you will do right by them in the end.  Reputation matters.

### Honest communication
Building trust facilitates a support engagement, the customer is more willing to invest time into communicating on a ticket when they believe what you say.
 
- **Don’t make promises you can’t keep**: Be careful with commitments.  If you promise a follow up put it on your calendar.  
- **Tell them what they don't want to hear**: When the news isn't good, tear the band-aid off ... as gently as possible.
- **Admit mistakes**: Use discretion in regards to the details you share, but admit it when a fault has been made and follow up with a plan to make it right.  If your plan involves other folks talk to them before making a commitment.  Focus on the problem not who is at fault.

### No silos
- No support tiers
- Open communication
- Open inboxes
- Try to use open channels and avoid DMs

## Practice positivity and empathy 
Support is a high stress position.  It can be hard to take a step back and build a mental model of the folks you interact with but it pays dividends.  Indicate that you understand someones point of view and it shows you are engaged and working towards the same goal.  They usually reciprocate.

### For end users / customers

- **Pay attention / "listen"**
- **Consider why a customer is acting out**:  Customers are usually frustrated to some degree when they engage support.  It's important to acknowledge and empathize with them.
- **Genuine human communication**
- **Beware scripts and copy pasta**
- **Don't badmouth the customers**: As a general rule.  It's OK to have a bit of a laugh at a ticket, but don't cross the line into gossip or bullying.  Don't lose your empathy for the human being on the other side of that ticket.  Even if you think they can't hear you, it spills over.
- **Surprise and delight**


### For team
**Support engineers**
- No managing by metrics
- Constant positive reinforcement

**Software engineers**
- Understand the software development process
- Respect valuable time

## Autonomy with social responsibility
### Be bold
- Break the rules sometimes
### Work in small pods (or leaderless teams)
### Cross functional support team
- Product / Project managers on support rotation
- Support / Ops
- Support / Documentation
- Support / Software engineering
### Empowerment
- Access to technical resources
- Offer refunds or coupons at discretion
### Positivity
- Celebrate wins: call out each others successes

# Hiring

Support has a reputation for being soul crushing work.  Agents are micromanaged incessantly: forced to follow scripts, judged by metrics that are not in their power to control.  They're undermanned and the queue is out of control.  Customers are frustrated and take it out on them.  The brightest and best move on, taking on new roles that present less of a threat to their mental health.  They rarely return as the role is so maligned it can be considered a black mark on your resume.
