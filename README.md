# Values:

## Communicate with transparency and integrity
Transparency and integrity aren't just some do gooderish ideals, they provide solid business value.  Trust is an asset.  A customer is more likely to stick with you after a crisis if they believe you will do right by them in the end.  Reputation matters.

### Honest communication
Building trust facilitates a support engagement, the customer is more willing to invest time into communicating on a ticket when they believe what you say.
 
- **Don’t make promises you can’t keep**: Be careful with commitments.  If you promise a follow up put it on your calendar.  
- **Tell them what they don't want to hear**: When the news isn't good, tear the band-aid off ... as gently as possible.
- **Admit mistakes**: Use discretion in regards to the details you share, but admit it when a fault has been made and follow up with a plan to make it right.  If your plan involves other folks talk to them before making a commitment.
